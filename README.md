Rainfall Prediction Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and preparing a dataset for predicting rainfall, specifically targeting the `RainTomorrow` variable. The dataset, `weatherAUS.csv`, includes weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall records from various locations in Australia. The primary goal is to preprocess the data and address class imbalance, making it suitable for predictive modeling.

Dataset
- Name: `weatherAUS.csv`
- Description: Contains weather-related data, including predictors such as temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall, and a target variable `RainTomorrow`, indicating whether it will rain the following day.

Steps Involved

1. Importing and Uploading Data
The dataset is uploaded and loaded into a pandas DataFrame. This step allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the data.

2. Data Inspection
- Used `.shape` to identify the number of rows and columns.
- Applied `.info()` to inspect column data types and identify missing values.
- Displayed the first few rows with `.head()` to understand the dataset structure.

3. Data Preprocessing
- Converted categorical variables (`RainToday` and `RainTomorrow`) into numeric values:
  - `No` -> 0
  - `Yes` -> 1

 4. Class Imbalance Visualization
- Visualized the distribution of the `RainTomorrow` variable using a bar plot.
- Observed a significant imbalance, with more instances of `No` compared to `Yes`.

5. Handling Class Imbalance
- Addressed the imbalance by oversampling the minority class (`Yes`) using the `resample` method from `sklearn.utils`.
- Combined the oversampled data with the majority class to create a balanced dataset.

6. Visualization of Balanced Data
- Created a bar plot to confirm the balanced distribution of `RainTomorrow` values after oversampling.

Results
The dataset was successfully preprocessed and balanced, ensuring that it is ready for machine learning models to predict rainfall accurately.

Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For oversampling to handle class imbalance.

Future Steps
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) on the prepared dataset.
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deploy the best-performing model for real-time rainfall prediction.
